## Point transformation
To transform a point $p$ from coordinate system $\alpha$ to $\beta$ we use transformation equation 
$$ p_\beta = T^\alpha_\beta p_\alpha,$$
where $p_\alpha$ is a column vector in homogeneous coordinates of the point $p$ in the coordinate system $\alpha$, $T^\alpha_\beta$ is a transformation matrix between coordinate system $\beta$ and $\alpha$. In the code we denote the same transformation $T\_\alpha\_to\_\beta$. The transformations are represented in the drawings as an arrow:
